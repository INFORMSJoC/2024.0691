The data <code>yeast.rda</code> comes from [KEGG database](https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/sce04011),
which belongs to the yeast Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway. Please refer 
the paper of Kanehisa et al. (2010) for details. <code>yeast_preprocess_data.RData</code> can be obtained by the script <code>data_clean.R</code> in the folder <code>scripts/yeast</code>, which preprocesses the raw data <code>yeast.rda</code>, and results in a screened dataset.

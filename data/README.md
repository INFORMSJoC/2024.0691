## Description 

The real data utilized in this paper were sourced from the [KEGG database](https://www.kegg.jp), which is not publicly accessible. To obtain the data, please subscribe to the [KEGG FTP service](https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/download/) first. After subscription, navigate to the "pathway" subdirectory (refer to [MAPK signaling pathway - yeast](https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/sce04011)) and download the MAPK pathway of yeast as a text file (.txt file). For the MAPK pathway of yeast, we treated markers and expression levels as covariates and responses, respectively. Markers were encoded as binary variables (1 and 2). A preliminary screening process was then conducted to eliminate redundant variables, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to a modest scale. Using the preprocessed data, we evaluated the performance of our proposed method and compared it with other competing methods.
